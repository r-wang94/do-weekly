# Episode 4: Choose

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about choosing.

Slot machines are not designed to help people win. They're designed to keep people playing. Every detail — the lights, the sounds, the speed of the reels, the shape of the chair — is engineered to remove the one thing that might make someone stop. A moment of conscious choice.

The gambling industry has a name for what happens when it works. They call it "the machine zone." A state where the player isn't trying to win. Isn't thinking about money. Isn't really thinking at all. The hand pulls. The reels spin. Nobody's home.

We don't have slot machines in our homes. But we have something pretty close. The endless scroll. The snack cupboard that opens. The Netflix thumbnail that loads up a TV show binge. Nobody has ever chosen to check their phone 96 times a day. But that's how often most people do. Not because they're weak. Because it all happened on autopilot.

Here's something worth trying. The next time you're about to do one of those automatic things — the things you keep saying you want to change — pause for one second and say three words. "I choose this."

Not "I shouldn't do this." Not "here I go again." Just: "I choose this."

"I choose to have this cigarette." "I choose to eat this snack even though I'm full." "I choose to skip the walk." "I choose to stay on the sofa."

Say it honestly. No guilt. No judgement. Just name it.

And then notice what happens. Because one of two things will. Either the sentence feels true — and you do it, and that's fine, because at least it was yours — or the sentence stops you. Not because anyone told you to stop. Because hearing yourself say "I choose this" made something click. Wait. Do I?

That's the strange power of the word "choose." It doesn't add pressure. It adds consciousness. And consciousness changes everything.

Most of the habits we want to change don't survive being named. They survive by staying automatic. The scroll happens because nobody notices the hand reaching. The snack happens because nobody notices the cupboard opening. The late night happens because nobody says "I choose to stay up." These things don't overpower us. They sneak past us.

This isn't about scolding yourself. It's the opposite. Scolding is what happens after — the guilt, the "why did I do that again." This happens before. And it's gentle. It's just a question dressed up as a statement. "I choose this." The question underneath is: do I?

And sometimes the answer is yes. Genuinely yes. And that's fine. Choosing a biscuit knowing you're choosing it is a completely different thing from finding yourself holding an empty wrapper and wondering what happened. One is conscious. The other is automatic. And it's the automatic that keeps us stuck. Not the biscuit.

You don't need more willpower. You don't need to be harder on yourself. You just need to be awake at the moment it matters. One second of consciousness, right before the thing you do without thinking.

So this week, pick one thing. Just one. The habit you keep meaning to change. And before you do it, say three words out loud. "I choose this."

Don't try to stop. Don't try to be better. Just say it. And see what the sentence does to the moment.

And if it only happens once. One single moment this week where you pause, say the words, and realise — I didn't even choose this. That's not a small thing. That's a victory. Because that one second of consciousness didn't exist before. And now it does.

The only thing standing between you and the change you wanted was a single, deliberate second of being awake.

So this week... is the week of choosing.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
