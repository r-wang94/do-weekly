# Week 3: Savour

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang, and this week we're going to talk about savouring.

In 1986, a McDonald's opened at the foot of the Spanish Steps in Rome, one of the most beautiful spots in Italy. And an Italian food writer called Carlo Petrini organised a protest. Not about the food. He wasn't waving signs about nutrition or calories or processed ingredients. He was protesting something quieter. Something harder to name. He said something was disappearing. The act of sitting down, tasting, being present for a meal. Not just rushing through it to get to the next thing. He started a movement, calling it Slow Food. Not slow as in sluggish. Slow as in deliberate. As in, this matters enough to actually be here for it.

Now that was 40 years ago. And whatever he was worried about losing, we've lost it. Not just with food, but with everything. The things that are supposed to be the good bits, you're barely in the room for them. The coffee you drink while clearing your inbox. The walk to school with a phone in your hand. The quiet after the kids are down, already lost to the bedtime scroll. The Sunday morning you'd been looking forward to all week spent planning Monday.

The good moments are there. They show up every day. You're just moving through them so quickly that they barely register. And it's not because you don't care. It's because somewhere along the way, lingering started to feel unproductive. There's always another email. Another person who needs something. Another rush. Enjoyment becomes something to fit in between tasks. Not something to dwell in. And now even when the good moment arrives, there's a pull underneath it. A restlessness. Not toward anything in particular. Just away from stillness. From savouring. Because savouring feels like falling behind.

It's not a character flaw. It's just what happens when life gets full. When there are people who need you. Deadlines that won't move. A house that won't run itself. The good gets squeezed into the gaps. And the gaps disappear. Especially when you're running your life on 1.5 speed.

A group of food scientists in England gave two groups the same piece of chocolate. Identical chocolate. One group ate it while doing a task on a screen. The other ate it in a quiet room with nothing else happening. The distracted group rated the chocolate as less flavourful, less satisfying, and then reached for more. The other group, the still group, ate less, rated it higher, and less of them reached for a second piece. Same chocolate, same amount. The only difference was attention. Without it, the brain doesn't fully register what it's receiving. So it asks for more. Not because you're greedy. But because you're starving in the middle of plenty.

You don't necessarily need more good things in your life. More luxury or more indulgence. You just need to be in the room when they happen. The morning coffee is good. The walk is good. The quiet is good. But if you keep half-leaving before they land, you might wonder why nothing feels like enough. Why you reach for the phone, the snack, the next thing. Always the next thing.

Savouring isn't a personality trait that some people have and others don't. It's a skill. One we had as children. And quietly, efficiently unlearned to adapt to the demands of modern life. And the thing about a skill is that you can pick it back up. You don't need to slow your whole life down. I know that most of us couldn't even if we tried. But you can choose one moment. One ordinary moment. And actually be in it. Savour it.

On a Monday evening, when the kids are down, there's a cup of tea. And instead of the sofa and the phone and the scroll, it's the kitchen window. Two minutes. The mug feeling warm in both hands. The garden going dark. Nothing urgent, nobody calling. And something loosens. Something that's been tight all day. Not because anything changed. But because someone was finally there for it.

So this week, try this. Pick one thing you already do every day. A cup of tea, or a walk, or a meal. And do it once without anything else happening. No phone. No list running in your head. Just the thing itself. Not because it'll change your life. But just to see what you've been missing. You have enough good things. Just sometimes you forget to savour them. So this week is the week of savouring. Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
