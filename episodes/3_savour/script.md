# Week 3: Savour

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang, and this week we're going to be talking about savouring.

So in 1986, a McDonald's opened at the foot of the Spanish Steps in Rome, one of the most beautiful spots in Italy. And an Italian food writer called Carlo Petrini organised a protest. Not about the food. He wasn't waving signs about nutrition or calories or processed ingredients. He was protesting something quieter. Something harder to name. He said something was disappearing. The act of sitting down, tasting, being present for a meal. Not just rushing through it to get to the next thing.

He started a movement, calling it Slow Food. Not slow as in sluggish. Slow as in deliberate. As in, this matters enough to actually be here for it.

Now that was 40 years ago. And whatever he was worried about losing? Well, we've lost it. Not just with food, but with everything. Whether it's the coffee drunk while clearing the inbox, the walk to school with a phone in one hand, the quiet after the kids are in bed already lost to the phone scroll, the Sunday morning spent thinking about Monday.

The good bits are there. They show up every day. They just don't get the attention they used to.

And it's not because we don't care. It's because somewhere along the way, lingering started to feel unproductive. There's always another email, another person who needs something, another rush. Enjoyment becomes something to fit in between tasks, not something to dwell in.

And now even when the good moment arrives, there's a pull underneath it. A restlessness. Not toward anything in particular, just away from stillness. From savouring. Because savouring feels like falling behind.

It's not a character flaw. It's just what happens when life gets full. When there are people who need us, or deadlines that won't move. A house that won't run itself. The good gets squeezed into the gaps, and the gaps disappear. Especially when we're running our lives on 1.5 speed.

A group of food scientists in England gave two groups the same piece of chocolate. Identical chocolate. One group ate it while doing a task on a screen, and the other ate it in a quiet room with nothing else happening. The distracted group rated the chocolate as less flavourful, less satisfying, and then reached for more. The other group, the still group, ate less, rated it higher, and less of them reached for a second piece. Same chocolate, same amount. The only difference was attention. Without it, the brain doesn't fully register what it's receiving, so it asks for more. Not because we're greedy, but because we're starving in the middle of plenty.

What I'm trying to say is that we don't necessarily need more good things in our lives. Whether that's more luxury or more indulgence. We just need to be in the room when they happen. The morning coffee is good. The walk is good. The quiet is good. But if we keep half-leaving before they land, we might wonder why nothing feels like enough. Why we reach for the phone, or the snack, or the next thing. More often than not, it's the next thing.

Savouring isn't a personality trait that some people have and others don't. It's a skill. One we had as children, and quietly, efficiently unlearned to adapt to the demands of modern life. And the thing about a skill is that we can pick it back up. We don't need to slow our whole lives down. I know most of us couldn't if we tried. But we can choose one moment. One ordinary moment, and actually be in it. Savour it.

And when we do, something strange happens. The tea tastes better. The quiet actually feels quiet. That tight thing beneath our ribs that we've been carrying around all day starts to let go. Not because anything in our lives changed, but because we were finally in the room for something good.

So our action this week is just to pick one thing that we already do every day. Whether that's a cup of tea, or a walk, or a meal. And do it once without anything else happening. No phone, no list running in our heads. Just the thing itself. Not because it'll change our lives, but just to see what we've been missing. We have enough good things. We just sometimes forget to savour them.

So this week is the week of savouring. Thank you for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
