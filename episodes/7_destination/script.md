# Episode 7: Destination

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about the destination.

There's a poem by Constantine Cavafy, a Greek poet, called Ithaca. It's about Odysseus sailing home after the Trojan War. Ten years of storms, monsters, strange islands. The whole journey driven by one thing. Getting home. But the poem doesn't celebrate the arrival. It barely mentions it. The last lines say this: "Ithaca gave you the marvellous journey. Without her you would not have set out." The destination was never the point. It was just the reason he started moving.

Health has the same problem. Most people are treating it like a place they haven't reached yet.

"I'll feel good about myself when I lose the weight." "I'll relax when things calm down." "I'll start looking after myself properly when..." When what? When the kids are older. When work settles. When the house is done. When January comes around. There's always a "when." And the "when" never arrives. Because every time someone gets to the place they were heading, there's a new place behind it. A new number on the scales. A new milestone set by the new health fad. A new version of "not quite there yet."

The goalposts don't just move. They were never fixed in the first place.

And so the feeling of not being there yet becomes permanent. Not a temporary state. More like a setting. Running in the background of everything. "I'm not quite where I want to be." Said on a Monday. Said in January. Said while catching a reflection and quietly measuring the distance between where they are and where they think they should be.

And it poisons the things that are actually working. The walk happened, but it wasn't far enough. The healthy week happened, but the number didn't move. The habit stuck for a month, but what does a month matter when the destination is still miles away? Nothing gets to count. Because counting requires arriving. And arriving keeps getting pushed back.

Here's what nobody says out loud. There is no distance. There is no gap.

The person who went for a walk this morning didn't take one step closer to becoming healthy one day. They were healthy. In that moment. In the act of walking. Not rehearsing for something. Not earning the right to feel good about themselves. Doing the thing itself. The walk wasn't step 47 of 1,000 on a road to somewhere. It was the somewhere.

The person who walks every morning is a walker. Not someone becoming one. Not someone who might be if they keep it up long enough. A walker. Now. The identity doesn't wait for the destination. It lives in the action.

And once you see that, something shifts. The early night last Tuesday counted. The meal you cooked from scratch on Wednesday counted. The five minutes you sat quietly before the house woke up counted. Not as progress toward something. As the thing itself. You didn't need to finish anything to earn them. They were already yours.

But here's the other side. And both sides matter.

There's no finish line. No point where health is complete and you can file it away. And that might sound heavy at first. But sit with it for a second. Because if there's no finish line, there's no deadline. No behind. No "I should be further along by now." No catching up. Just today. And what you do with it.

That's what Cavafy was writing about. The journey doesn't end. And that's not the punishment. That's the gift. Because every morning is a fresh version of the same quiet question. Not "how far do I still have to go?" Just "what am I doing today?"

And here's what it actually feels like when the pressure to arrive dissolves. The walk stops being something you tick off and starts being the best ten minutes of your morning. The food stops being something you're getting right or wrong and becomes something you actually enjoy. The early night stops being a rule and starts being a kindness you give yourself. You stop counting and start noticing. How quiet the kitchen is before everyone's up. How your body feels after you've moved. How the evening opens up when you're not trying to fix yourself in it.

That's not a future version of your life. That's available now. Not when the weight is gone. Not when the streak is long enough. Now. In the next small thing you do for yourself.

So this week, notice the sentence "I'll feel better when..." or "I'll be happy once..." every time it appears. Don't fight it. Just notice it. And ask yourself one question. What if I'm already there?

What if this, right now, is it?

So this week... is the week of destination.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
