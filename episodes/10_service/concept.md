# Episode 10: Service — The difference between obligation and devotion

## Theme
Obligation and devotion. Two words. Everyone knows exactly what both feel like. Obligation is heavy, tight, dutiful. You do it because you should. Devotion is warm, chosen, alive. You do it because it's yours. We use the same word — "caring" — for both, but they are not the same thing. Not even close. And the people around you can feel the difference.

## Pillar(s)
- **Relax** — obligation keeps the nervous system in threat mode. Devotion settles it.
- **Connection** — obligation is a performance of connection. Devotion is the real thing.

## Key principles drawn from
- **Core Happiness: Alignment** — obligation without alignment creates quiet corrosion. Devotion is alignment in action.
- **Connection as a Core Human Need** — connection through performance doesn't land for either person.

## The deeper emotional truth
The listener has spent years calling both things "caring" and wondering why some of it feels like love and some of it feels like a slow leak. The episode names the difference. Not to judge — but to say: you already knew. You just didn't have the words.

## Creative approach
- **The two words as the engine.** Don't bury the lead. Obligation and devotion are the hook, the reframe, and the close. Let those two words do the heavy lifting.
- **Specificity creates cinema.** What obligation looks and feels like in the body. What devotion looks and feels like. Make the listener feel both so clearly they can sort their own week into two columns without being told to.

## CTA
Two things this week. One honest "no" — something you'd normally say yes to out of obligation. And one wholehearted "yes" — something you do for someone because it's genuinely yours. See how they feel different.
