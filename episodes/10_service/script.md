# Week 10: Service

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about service.

In 1964, Glenn Gould, one of the greatest pianists alive, played his last ever concert. He was 31. Not retiring from music. Just from performing it in front of people. He spent the rest of his life in recording studios, alone with a piano, playing Bach until every note sounded exactly the way he heard it in his head. No audience. No applause. No tour schedule.

The world thought he was eccentric. Maybe he was. But he'd made a distinction most people never make. The concert stage had become obligation. The studio was devotion. Same hands. Same music. Completely different feeling.

Two words. Obligation. And devotion. Everyone knows exactly what both feel like.

Obligation is the school run on no sleep when nobody said thank you yesterday either. It's the phone call answered with a small sigh you hope they didn't hear. "Yes, of course" when every part of you is saying "not today." It's doing the right thing with your jaw slightly clenched.

Devotion is different. Devotion is driving across town at 11pm because your friend called and you could hear it in her voice. It's Saturday breakfast that nobody asked for, and the kitchen smells like butter. It's sitting with your mum and actually being there. Not checking the time. Not thinking about what's next. Just there.

Same person. Same kind of act. Completely different feeling.

We call it all "caring." We call it all "being there." But obligation and devotion are not the same thing. Not even close. And the people around you. Your kids. Your partner. Your friends. They know which one they're getting. They might not say it. But they know.

There's a warmth to devotion you can't fake. And there's a thinness to obligation that no amount of effort can disguise.

So why do most of us spend so much of our weeks in obligation and so little in devotion?

Because somewhere along the way, a set of rules got written. "Good mothers just get on with it." "Good partners don't make a fuss." "Good daughters always pick up the phone." Those rules sound like love. But they're not. They're a script. And the problem with living by a script someone else wrote is that it stops the question from ever being asked: is any of this actually mine?

Devotion doesn't follow rules. It doesn't need them. It comes from something quieter than duty. The part that says "this matters to me" before anyone else has weighed in. And when you act from that place, it doesn't wear you down the way obligation does. It does something strange. It steadies you.

Think about the last time you did something for someone and it felt unmistakably chosen. Not because you had to. Not because it was expected. Because something in you wanted to. Maybe it was small. Maybe nobody noticed. But you felt different afterwards. Not drained. Settled.

That's devotion. It's been there all along. It just gets buried under all the obligation.

Most of us have never sorted our week into those two piles. Never looked at everything we do for other people and asked: which of this is obligation and which is devotion? Which is a script I inherited and which is genuinely mine?

It's a confronting question. Because the answer might mean some things need to change. Not all of them. Just the ones that have been quietly corroding you while looking like love.

So this week, two things.

Say one honest "no." Something you would normally agree to out of obligation. Not cruelly. Just clearly. And pay attention to what shifts.

And say one wholehearted "yes." Something you do for someone this week not because you should, but because it's yours. And pay attention to that too.

One of each. Let the difference speak for itself.

Because the people you love don't need more of your obligation. They need more of your devotion. And so do you.

So this week... is the week of service.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
