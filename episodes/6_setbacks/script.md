# Episode 6: Setbacks

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about setbacks.

I used to row. And during that time, I injured my back. Badly. What started as a rowing injury led to something bigger. A spine deformity that nobody had picked up before. I was supposed to be in hospital as a medical student, not as a patient. And for a period after that, I was largely immobilised.

I remember lying there, and at some point the question arrived. Not "why me." Not "what now." Just: am I done? And the answer was no. It wasn't dramatic. It wasn't brave. It was just the only honest answer I had. And if the answer is no, there's only one direction left.

I want to come back to that question later. But first, I want to talk about what happens before it. Not the setback itself. The story that arrives the moment after.

Because a setback is usually just a fact. A bad week. A missed target. Wrappers on the counter. Walking shoes untouched by the door. The scales that haven't moved after a month of trying. None of it is catastrophic on its own. None of it is the thing that actually stops someone.

What stops people is the story that attaches to the fact. "I always do this." "I can't stick to anything." "Who was I kidding?" That's not the setback talking. That's a verdict. And once the verdict lands, the fact doesn't matter anymore. The missed walk wasn't the problem. The sentence "I'm not someone who follows through" was the problem. A small stumble became proof of something permanent. The setback was an event. The story made it an identity.

And then something nobody talks about. The trainers come off the hook by the door. The subject changes when someone asks how it's going. The thing that was being built quietly stops being mentioned. Not because of a decision to quit. Because admitting the stall feels worse than the stalling itself.

That's what setbacks really do. They don't just pause progress. They make you pretend you were never progressing.

But the people who seem to have it together? They've had the same weeks. The runner who's out every morning has missed whole months. The friend who eats well had a winter of takeaways. They didn't avoid setbacks. They just didn't treat them as verdicts. The stumble happened and they kept going. Not because they're stronger. Because they didn't let the story land.

There's something worse than the story. The feeling of being back to zero. That all those weeks of trying have been wiped clean. That the person who started has vanished and you'd have to become them all over again.

But that's the story talking. Not the truth. Nothing was erased. The walks still happened. The early nights still counted. The weeks of showing up didn't disappear because one week didn't go to plan. The person who tried for six weeks and stumbled is in a completely different place from the person who never started. The progress is still there. You just can't see it through the shame.

In any setback, there are really only two options. Give up, or keep going. There is no "I'll wait until I feel ready." That's just stopping with better packaging.

When I started coming back, the first thing I did wasn't dramatic. It was tiny. Almost embarrassingly small. But it was forward. And forward was enough.

Coming back didn't feel like starting over. It felt like picking up something I'd put down. The body doesn't hold grudges the way the mind does. One small thing after weeks of nothing didn't feel like punishment. It felt like relief. Like coming home to something I'd forgotten was mine.

The hardest part was never the setback. It was the gap. The waiting. The story filling every day of it, getting louder. Once I took one step, the story ran out of oxygen. And the momentum rebuilt itself faster than I thought it would. Not because I was strong. Because momentum doesn't need much. It just needs forward.

So this week, when something doesn't go to plan. And something won't. Notice the story. Not the setback itself. The story. The one that says "this is who you really are." And instead of believing it, ask yourself one question.

Am I done?

If the answer is no, then the story is wrong. Keep going.

Churchill said, "If you're going through hell, keep going." Not because it gets easier. Because the only alternative is staying there.

So this week... is the week of setbacks.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
