# Episode 6: Setbacks — Give up or keep going. There is no third option.

## Theme
Setbacks aren't interruptions to the journey. They ARE the journey. When something knocks you down — an injury, a diagnosis, a relapse into old habits, a week where everything falls apart — you face exactly two choices. Give up or keep going. There is no third option. There is no "wait until I feel ready." There is no "I'll start again when things are easier." You're either moving forward, however slowly, or you've stopped. This episode uses Robin's real experience — a back injury from rowing, a spine deformity, hospitalisation, and a period of being largely immobilised — to ground the idea in something lived, not theoretical.

## Pillar(s)
- **Move** — the injury directly removed the ability to move. Getting it back was the fight.
- **Relax** — the mental toll of being immobilised, the identity crisis of losing physical capability.
- **All four** — setbacks cascade across every pillar. One thing breaks and everything shifts.

## Key principles drawn from
- **Identity-Based Change** — a setback threatens identity ("I'm not someone who can do this anymore"). The recovery is partly about rebuilding identity, not just rebuilding the body.
- **Root Causes, Not Symptoms** — the temptation during a setback is to focus on the surface problem. The deeper work is about the relationship with yourself under pressure.
- **The Threshold Effect** — setbacks push you over your threshold. Recovery is about getting back under it, one small thing at a time.

## The deeper emotional truth
The listener has had setbacks. Maybe not a hospitalisation. Maybe a week where they ate everything they said they wouldn't. Maybe a month where they stopped exercising. Maybe a diagnosis that changed the rules. And the voice in their head says: "See? You can't do this." This episode says: the setback isn't evidence that you've failed. It's evidence that you were trying. And the only question that matters now is: are you done?

## Creative approach
- **Robin's real story as the opener.** The back injury, the rowing, the spine deformity, the hospital. This is the first episode where Robin shares something deeply personal and it opens the episode. No external story, no metaphor — just Robin, telling you what happened. The confession shape. It earns its weight because it's real and because the listener didn't expect it from their doctor. Robin needs to provide the specific details — timeline, what happened, what the lowest point felt like, what the first step back looked like.
- **Churchill placed elegantly inside or at the close.** "If you're going through hell, keep going." Not as the opening — as a landing point. After Robin's story has established the weight, the quote arrives with earned authority. Could sit just before the CTA or as the final sticky line before sign-off.
- **The binary as the reframe.** Two choices. Only ever two. Strip away the noise, the excuses, the "I'll start Monday." You're either going or you've stopped. And if you're listening to this, you haven't stopped.

## CTA
This week, if something doesn't go to plan — and something won't — notice the moment where the voice says "see, it's not working." And instead of listening, ask one question: am I done? If the answer is no, then the setback doesn't matter. Keep going.

## Notes for Robin
This concept needs your real details to work. Specifically:
- How old were you when the injury happened?
- What was the rowing context — competitive, university, recreational?
- What was the spine deformity — was it discovered because of the injury or pre-existing?
- How long were you in hospital? What was the immobilisation period?
- What was the lowest moment? What did giving up look like from the inside?
- What was the first thing you did when you started coming back? The smallest step.
- How does this experience inform how you think about setbacks now, as a doctor?
