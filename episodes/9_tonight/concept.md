# Episode 9: Tonight — Tomorrow starts tonight

## Theme
We pour all our energy into fixing the morning — alarms, routines, apps — when the real problem is the night before. The best morning routine starts at 9pm. The evening feels like "our" time, the first moment all day where nobody needs anything. So we treat it like free time: scrolling, snacking, one more episode. But while we're not paying attention, tomorrow is already being written.

## Pillar(s)
- **Sleep** — the master regulator. This is the flagship sleep episode.
- **Eat** — melatonin impairs insulin response, so the same meal at 9pm is more metabolically damaging than at 6pm. Late eating is built into the evening pattern.
- **Relax** — the 90-minute wind-down. The camp-fire environment. Phone in the kitchen is a nervous system signal, not just a sleep hygiene tip.

## Key principles drawn from
- **Sleep as master regulator** (Prof. Matt Walker) — "There is no tissue within the body and no process within the brain that is not enhanced by sleep." Poor sleep increases ghrelin, decreases leptin — you wake up programmed to eat more and feel less satisfied.
- **Melatonin and insulin** (Dr. Satchin Panda) — the hard-science reason why eating late is different from eating early. Melatonin impairs the insulin response.
- **Light/dark contrast** (Prof. Russell Foster) — the SCN needs a clear "IT'S NIGHT" signal. Bright screens at 10pm do the opposite. Dim, warm lighting in the last 90 minutes allows melatonin to rise naturally.
- **Sleep debt is non-recoverable** — you can't catch up on weekends. Consistency beats sporadic recovery.
- **Environment > Willpower** — phone in the kitchen isn't discipline. It's designing the evening so the right choice is the easy one.

## The deeper emotional truth
The evening is where "I deserve a rest" and "I deserve to feel good tomorrow" come into conflict. And most nights, the scroll wins — not because it's what we need, but because it's what's there. The reframe: putting the phone down at 9 isn't giving something up. It's doing something for the person you'll be in the morning.

## Creative approach used
- **Two mornings contrasted** — the 6-hour alarm after scrolling vs. the morning where sleep came faster than expected. Same person, same life, different night, different morning.
- Opens by dropping the listener into a scene: 10pm Tuesday, sofa, phone, not looking for anything.
- The closing line: "Tomorrow is already listening."

## CTA
Not an action — a noticing exercise. Tonight, pay attention to the last hour before bed. Don't change anything. Just watch it. What are you reaching for? When does resting become hiding? How does your body feel when you get under the covers? And tomorrow morning, notice how you wake up. Connect those two dots.
