# Week 9: Tonight

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about tonight.

Before every commercial flight, pilots are legally required to have a minimum rest period. Not a suggestion. Regulated by law. Because everyone on that plane depends on what happened the night before. No one questions this. No one says "well, the pilot had a busy week" or "they deserve to unwind." If the rest isn't right, the plane doesn't fly.

We'd never let a pilot fly on the kind of night most of us had last Tuesday.

And yet. You're running a household. Making decisions all day. Showing up for people who depend on you. And nobody protects your night before. Least of all you.

The best morning routine starts at 9pm.

We spend so much energy trying to fix the wrong end of the day. More alarms. Better routines. Apps that track our sleep. Promising ourselves that this Monday, we'll get up earlier. Move more. Be different.

But the morning was never the problem.

Think about how much attention you give your evenings. The evening is the bit after the day is "done." After the last email. After everyone's been fed and sorted. It feels like the one stretch that belongs to us. The first moment all day where nobody needs anything.

And because it feels like free time, we treat it like free time.

Scrolling. Snacking. One more episode. Not because of laziness. Because the whole day has been spent showing up for everyone else, and the path of least resistance is right there, glowing in our hands.

But something happens while we're not paying attention. By the time we go to bed, it's too late. Too wired. Too full. Tomorrow is already written.

We think the evening is the end of today.

It's not. Tonight is where tomorrow begins.

Every good morning starts the night before. And every rough one. That fog when the alarm goes off. That heaviness. That was built the night before too.

Once you see that, something shifts. Putting the phone down at 9 isn't discipline. It's not giving something up. It's doing something for the person you'll be in the morning. Looking after yourself the same way you look after everyone else all day long.

Most of us are really practised at showing up for other people. Less practised at this. The evening is where it shows up most clearly. The quiet moment where "I deserve a rest" and "I deserve to feel good tomorrow" come into conflict. And most nights, the scroll wins. Not because it's what we need. Because it's what's there.

Now picture a different night. Same week. One thing changes. At 9, the phone goes in the kitchen. You make something warm. The lights come down a bit. Not dark, just softer.

You're in bed by half ten. Sleep comes faster than you expected. The alarm goes off and this time it sounds different. You're not leaping out of bed. You're just ready enough.

Same person. Same life. Different night. Different morning.

So this week, I'm not going to ask you to do something. I'm going to ask you to notice something.

Tonight, pay attention to the last hour before bed. Don't change anything. Just watch it. What are you reaching for? When does resting become hiding? How does your body feel when you finally get under the covers?

And tomorrow morning, notice how you wake up.

That's it. Just connect those two dots. The evening and the morning after.

Because once you see the thread between tonight and tomorrow, you won't need me to tell you what to do next.

Tomorrow is already listening.

So this week... is the week of tonight.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
