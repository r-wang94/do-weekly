# Episode 1: Identity — You are what you repeat

## Theme
What if the habits you struggle to build could feel as effortless as the ones you already have? Identity-based change means shifting who you believe you are, not just what you do. The shift from "I'm trying to eat better" to "I'm someone who eats vegetables with dinner" removes the daily fight. Small actions become votes for who you're becoming.

## Pillar(s)
All four — this is a foundational episode introducing the method. The identity frame applies to any pillar: "I'm someone who walks," "I'm someone who winds down before bed," "I'm someone who eats vegetables with meals."

## Key principles drawn from
- **Identity-based behaviour change** (James Clear) — the most lasting change comes from focusing on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve. "Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."
- **B=MAP** (B.J. Fogg) — Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. Since motivation is unreliable, we anchor tiny habits to existing automatic behaviours.
- **Emotions create habits, not repetition** — celebration after a small action releases dopamine, rewiring the brain to want to repeat it.
- **Environment > Willpower** — the sticky note on the mirror is an environment design move, not just a reminder.

## The deeper emotional truth
You haven't failed. You've been using a strategy (willpower, self-control) that was never designed to last. The listener should leave feeling that their drawer of half-used journals isn't evidence of weakness — it's evidence of experience.

## Creative approach used
- Opening with universal identity labels (vegetarian, tea drinker, phone picker-upper) that feel effortless, then asking: what if you could do the same with health?
- "Votes" metaphor — you don't have to win every vote, just the majority.

Write a single identity sentence on a sticky note. Put it where you'll see it. Let it sit.
