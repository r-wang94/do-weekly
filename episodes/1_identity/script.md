# Week 1: Identity

---

## INTRO

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I am Dr Robin Wang and this week, we will be discussing the power of Identity.

## HOOK

I want you to think for a second about what you identify as. Not your name. Not your job title. The deeper stuff. Personally, I'm someone who calls my mum every day. I can't leave the house in the morning unless I've made my bed.

Maybe you're a sister. A vegetarian. Or, you're someone who's always early. Someone who always picks up the phone when a friend calls.

Now notice something. Those labels feel effortless. You don't wake up every morning and decide to be a vegetarian. You don't have to motivate yourself to pick up the phone. You just are that person. And your decisions flow from that, almost automatically, without you even thinking about it.

I was asking myself the question: What if I applied this to the habits I was struggling to build?

## PROBLEM

Here's what's actually going on when we try to change. Most of us rely on self-control. We grit our teeth. We try harder. We make it through the first week and wonder why we're back where we started by week three.

But the problem was never you. The problem was the strategy. Self-control can keep you going at something if you try hard enough, but after a while, it runs out. Willpower can fade by lunchtime. Identity can stay with you forever.

## INSIGHT

The writer James Clear puts it simply. He says the most lasting change doesn't come from focusing on what you want to achieve. It comes from focusing on who you want to become.

Let me show you the difference.

"I'm trying to walk more" versus "I'm someone who walks."

"I'm cutting out sugar" versus "I'm someone who doesn't really have a sweet tooth."

One is a fight you have to win every day. The other is just... you.

## STORY

Let's talk about an email exchange I had with Emma. She was telling me about the difficulties she faced in sticking to her habits. She wanted to add greens to her evening meals. But, after a long day of work, with her kids asking her what's for tea. She's standing in the kitchen and thinks... let's just order in. I'll start next week.

Emma's not failing. She's fighting. Stuck in a tug of war between what she wants to do and what feels easy. And she's been having that same fight for months.

But what if Emma didn't have to fight? What if, instead of being someone who's trying to eat better, she just started thinking of herself as someone who has vegetables with dinner? Not every night. Not perfectly. Just most of the time. Because that's who she is.

That's the shift.

Now, I'm not saying you wake up tomorrow and announce, "I'm a marathon runner who meditates and eats kale for breakfast." I'm asking you to take one small but meaningful step.

Every small action you take is a vote for the kind of person you're becoming.

You don't have to win every vote. You just have to win the majority.

You go for a ten-minute walk at lunch. That's a vote for being someone who walks.

You add some spinach to the pasta sauce on a Tuesday night. That's a vote for being someone who eats vegetables without making a fuss about it.

You put your phone in another room before bed. That's a vote for being someone who takes sleep seriously.

None of these are dramatic. That's the point. Each one tells your brain: this is who I am now.

And then something shifts. The behaviour stops being something you force and starts being something you just... do.

Exactly like being someone who makes their bed in the morning. Exactly like being someone who picks up the phone when a friend calls.

## CTA

So here's what I'd like you to do this week. One thing.

Write a single sentence on a sticky note. A sentence that describes the kind of person you'd like to be.

"I'm someone who moves every day."

"I'm someone who winds down before bed."

"I'm someone who eats vegetables with meals."

Pick one. Write it down. Put it on your bathroom mirror, your fridge, wherever you'll see it. And just let it sit there. Let your brain get used to reading it.

Let it become your story.

And if you're listening to this thinking, I've tried so many times before...

If you've got a drawer full of half-used journals and an abandoned couch-to-5k app still on your phone... that doesn't mean you lack discipline. It means you were using a strategy that was never designed to last, and it means you have experience.

You're not starting from scratch. You're starting from a place of wisdom.

So this week, one sentence. One sticky note. Stop trying to force yourself into good habits. Start becoming the kind of person for whom those habits make sense.

You already know how identity works. You do it every day without thinking. Now you're just going to do it on purpose.

So this week….is the week of identity.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
