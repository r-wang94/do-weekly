# Week 3: Notice

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're doing something a bit different.

I want to talk about noticing. And then I want us to try it. Together. 

If you've ever downloaded a meditation app, sat there for three minutes, thought about your shopping list, and decided you're just not a meditation person. This one's for you.

Because the instructions are always the same. Clear your mind. Focus on your breath. Let your thoughts go. And when your mind wanders, which it does, perhaps immediately, it feels like you've failed.

But that's like saying you're bad at exercise because your muscles get tired. The wandering isn't the failure. The noticing that you wandered is the whole point. That moment where you catch yourself drifting off to tomorrow's to-do list and you think "oh, I've gone somewhere else." That is the practice. You already did it. You just didn't know it counted.

Noticing isn't something you need to learn. It's something you already do. You just don't always do it on purpose.

Most of us spend our days on autopilot. And we're good at it. We eat while we check emails. We drive entire routes without remembering a single turn. We ask "how are you?" without hearing the answer. Not because we don't care, but because there's so much coming at us all the time that we've learned to tune most of it out, just to get through the day.

And it works. But it does cost us something. Because when you spend your whole day half-present, you end up feeling like the days are long but the weeks are short. Like time is passing through you rather than with you.

So here's what I'd like us to try. Right now. Not later.  Wherever you are. Whatever you're doing.

You don't need to close your eyes. You don't need to sit any particular way. You definitely don't need to feel relaxed. Just stay exactly where you are.

[3s]

Notice what you can hear right now. Not my voice. What's behind it. Maybe there's traffic outside, or a fridge humming, or someone moving around in another room. Whatever it is, you don't need to do anything about it. Just let it be there.

[6s]

Now notice where your body is making contact with something. The chair or seat beneath you. Your feet on the floor. Your hands wherever they're resting or whatever they're holding on to. Just feel the weight of yourself for a second, held up by something solid.

[6s]

Notice the temperature of the air on your skin. Is it warm? Cool? Moving?

[6s]

And stay here. You don't need to do anything with this. You don't need to feel calm or peaceful or any particular way. Just notice that you're here. Right now. In this second. That's all. Let's stay here for a moment together, in a bit of silence.

[10s]

Alright. That's it.

[3s]

No special app. No timer. Just a few seconds of actually being where you already were. That was the whole thing.

You know that low hum of anxiety that just sits in the background and won't shift? Almost none of it is about what's happening right now. It's about what happened earlier or what might happen tomorrow. We spend most of our time living in the gap between the past and the future. 

Eckhart Tolle, the philosopher, put it simply. We're never fully in the now, because unconsciously, we believe the next moment must be more important than this one. So we end up forgetting that right now, in this actual moment, we're usually okay.

Noticing pulls you back into that moment. Not forever. Just long enough to remember it exists. During a busy day, when there's always one more email to send, one more thing on the list, one more person who needs something from you, those few seconds are everything. They're the difference between a day that happened to you and a day you were actually in.

You don't need twenty minutes. You just need to notice one real thing. A sound, a sensation, a breath. On purpose.

So this week, there's nothing to change. Nothing to start. Just notice. Once a day, for a few seconds, wherever you are. When the kettle's boiling and you'd normally reach for your phone. When you're washing your hands and the water's warm. When you sit down at the end of a long day on your feet and feel the weight of your body in the chair.

You're not learning something new. You're remembering something you already know how to do.

The quietest part of your day is already there. You just need to listen to it.

So this week... is the week of noticing.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
