# Week 4: Setbacks

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about setbacks.

When I was in medical school, I was obsessed with rowing. Twice a day, six times a week. During this time, I injured my back badly. What we thought was a sports injury turned out to be something bigger. A spine deformity that had been there all along, but nobody had found it. I ended up in hospital. I was supposed to be there as a student, not as a patient. After that, I could barely move for months.

I remember lying there. Not asking deep questions. Not having some moment of clarity. Just thinking: this sucks. That's about as deep as it got.

Most setbacks in life are quieter than that. A bad week. A missed target. Wrappers on the counter. Walking shoes untouched by the door. But somehow, the quiet ones are harder to come back from.

What stops people isn't the setback itself. It's the verdict that follows. "I always do this." "I can't stick to anything." "This sucks!" And suddenly the missed walk isn't a missed walk anymore. It's proof. A bad week becomes a life sentence.

And then something nobody talks about. The trainers come off the hook by the door. The subject changes when someone asks how it's going. The thing that was being built quietly stops being mentioned. Not because of a decision to quit. Because admitting the stall feels worse than the stalling itself.

That's what setbacks really do. They don't just pause progress. They make you pretend you were never progressing.

But nothing was erased. The walks still happened. The early nights still counted. The weeks of showing up didn't disappear because one week didn't go to plan. The person who tried for six weeks and stumbled is in a completely different place from the person who never started. The progress is still there. You just can't see it through the shame.

The runner who's out every morning has missed whole months. The friend who cooks from scratch had a winter where everything came from a packet. I had a spine injury and 3 months on my back. Everyone who's ever built something lasting has cracks in it. They just didn't let a bad month become a verdict.

When I started coming back, the first thing I did was almost embarrassingly small. But it was forward. And it didn't feel like starting over. It felt like picking up something I'd put down. The body doesn't hold grudges the way the mind does. One small thing after weeks of nothing didn't feel like punishment. It felt like relief. And the momentum came back faster than I expected. Not because I was strong. Because momentum doesn't need much. It just needs forward.

I don't just look back on that time and think I survived it. I think it made me a different kind of doctor. When someone sits across from me and tells me they've been trying for months and nothing's shifted, I don't just hear the facts. I hear what they're not saying. The shame. The feeling that they've let themselves down. I hear it because I've felt it. 

The friend who really gets it when you're struggling isn't the one who had it easy. It's the one who's been there. The kindness that actually lands comes from someone who knows what it costs.

Sometimes, parts of us break. But for me, it turns out the broken part was actually a useful one.

There's a Japanese art called kintsugi. When a valuable vase or piece of pottery breaks, they don't throw it away. They fill every crack with gold. The repair becomes the most beautiful part of the bowl. Not despite the breaking. Because of it. A bowl that's never been broken has no gold in it.

Every week you tried to hide. Every time you changed the subject when someone asked how it was going. Those aren't the parts to be ashamed of. Those are the cracks.

This week will have one too. Something won't go to plan. And when that voice shows up — "I always do this," "what's the point" — it's a setback. Not a full stop. The cracks are where the gold goes.

So this week... is the week of setbacks.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
