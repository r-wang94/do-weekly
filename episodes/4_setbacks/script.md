# Week 4: Setbacks

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about setbacks.

When I was in medical school, I was obsessed with rowing. Twice a day, six times a week. During this time, I injured my back badly. What we thought was a sports injury turned out to be something bigger. A spine deformity that had been there all along, but nobody had found it. I ended up in hospital. I was supposed to be there as a student, not as a patient. After that, I could barely move for weeks.

I remember lying there. Not asking deep questions. Not having some moment of clarity. Just thinking: this sucks. That's about as deep as it got.

Most setbacks in life are quieter than that. A bad week. A missed target. Wrappers on the counter. Walking shoes untouched by the door. But somehow, the quiet ones are harder to come back from.

What stops people isn't the setback itself. It's the verdict that follows. "I always do this." "I can't stick to anything." "This sucks!" And suddenly the missed walk isn't a missed walk anymore. It's proof. A bad week becomes a life sentence.

The trainers come off the hook by the door. The subject changes when someone asks how it's going. The morning walks quietly stop being mentioned. Not because of a decision to quit. Because admitting the stall feels worse than the stalling itself.

That's what setbacks really do. They don't just pause progress. They make you pretend you were never progressing.

But here's what nobody tells you. Setbacks aren't a sign that something went wrong. They're a sign that you were in the game. You don't get knocked down from the sofa. You get knocked down because you were moving. And if you're playing the game at all, setbacks aren't the exception. They're part of the rules.

And nothing was erased. The walks still happened. The early nights still counted. The weeks of showing up didn't disappear because one week didn't go to plan. The progress is still there. We just sometimes can't see it through the guilt.

The runner who's out every morning has missed whole months. The friend who cooks from scratch had a winter where everything came from a packet. Everyone who's ever built something lasting has cracks in it. They just didn't let a bad month become a verdict.

When I started coming back, the first thing I did was almost embarrassingly small. But it was forward. And it didn't feel like starting over. It felt like picking up something I'd put down. The body doesn't hold grudges the way the mind does. One small thing after weeks of nothing didn't feel like punishment. It felt like relief. And the momentum came back faster than I expected. Not because I was strong. Because momentum doesn't need much. It just needs forward.

I don't just look back on that time and think I survived it. I think it made me a different kind of doctor. When someone sits across from me and tells me they've been trying for months and nothing's shifted, I don't just hear the facts. I hear what they're not saying. The shame. The feeling that they've let themselves down. I hear it because I've felt it. 

The friend who really gets it when you're struggling isn't the one who had it easy. It's the one who's been there. The kindness that actually lands comes from someone who knows what it costs.

In Japan, when a piece of pottery breaks, they don't throw it away. They have an art called kintsugi. They fill every crack with gold. The repair becomes the most beautiful part. Not despite the breaking. Because of it.

Every week you tried to hide. Every time you changed the subject. Those aren't failures. Those are the cracks. And the gold isn't some future version of you who gets it right. It's this version. The one who kept showing up even when it felt pointless.

This week, like most weeks, something might not go to plan. If that happens, when the verdict arrives — "I always do this" — don't fight it. Just do one thing forward. One walk. One early night. One meal you meant to cook. Our one thing this week: not to fix anything. Just to prove the verdict wrong.

The setbacks don't suddenly get easier. But once you start treating them as proof that you're in the game, they feel a bit less like the end of the world.

So this week... is the week of setbacks.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
