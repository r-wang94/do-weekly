# Week 5: Capacity

---

Hello and welcome to Do Health Weekly. I'm Dr Robin Wang and this week, we're talking about capacity.

A friend told me about a children's book called The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. A boy loves a tree. The tree loves him back. When he's young, they play together. But as he grows up, he keeps coming back asking for more. He needs money, so the tree gives him her apples to sell. He needs a house, so she gives her branches. He needs a boat, so she gives her trunk.

Every time, the same line. "And the tree was happy."

Until there's nothing left but a stump.

It's supposed to be a story about generosity. But I think there's more than that. I think it's a story about what happens when the giving never stops. When every part gets handed out, piece by piece, to whoever needs it next. And the hardest part? The tree never noticed it happening. Because each time, it was just one thing. Just the apples. Just the branches. Just one more yes.

Now, that's a children's book. But swap the tree for you. And swap the boy for... well, everything. The job. The kids. The admin. The friend who's going through something. The parent who needs help with the thing. Each one, on its own, completely reasonable. Just one more yes. Just the apples. Just the branches.

Most of us have been running on nothing so long we've forgotten what it feels like to have something left.

But here's what's interesting. Not that we end up there, because everyone does. But what we do once we're in it.

Everything in your week does one of two things. It either drains you or it charges you. And when you're running low, you'd think you'd protect the charges. But we do the opposite.

We keep every drain running. We answer the emails. We meet the obligations. We say yes to things we don't have the energy for. And we cut the things that would actually charge us back up. The Thursday evening swim gets cancelled. Your friend doesn't get called back. That book on the bedside table has had the same corner folded down for three weeks. The early night becomes another late one, because by the time everyone else is sorted, the evening is already gone.

We keep the drains. We cut the charges.

Now. Why?

It would be easy to say we're just bad at looking after ourselves. But it's subtler than that. We cut the charges because they always feel optional. The swim feels like a nice-to-have. Calling your friend feels like something you'll get round to when things calm down. The early night with some alone time feels like a luxury you haven't quite earned.

But the emails? The school run? The thing your mum needs help with? Those feel non-negotiable. They feel like duty. And duty always wins over anything that looks like it might be for you.

So we end up with everything backwards. The things that drain us feel essential. The things that fill us up feel indulgent. And that framing runs so deep most of us have never stopped to question it.

But here's where it gets really uncomfortable.

Being exhausted can start to feel like proof you're doing it right. Like running on empty is evidence you care enough. "I'm so busy." "I'm absolutely shattered." And everyone nods, because that's what a committed person sounds like, apparently. We wear our depletion like a badge without even realising it. Not because anyone pinned it on us. Because somewhere along the way, we decided that pouring from empty was the price of being needed.

But tiredness is not a personality. And empty is not a virtue.

When Jacinda Ardern stepped down as Prime Minister of New Zealand, she didn't point to a scandal or a crisis. She said, "I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice." That was it. The most powerful person in the country chose to stop before empty. Because she understood what pouring from empty actually costs.

What comes out when you keep giving from nothing isn't nothing. It's a worse version of everything. Less patient with your kids. Less present when someone you love actually needs you there. Less kind to yourself when you catch your reflection. Not because you've stopped caring. Because there's genuinely nothing left to draw from.

But when the charge stays. When the swim happens. When the walk isn't the thing that gets cancelled. Something changes.

It's not dramatic. You don't wake up transformed. But the 3pm slump doesn't hit the same way. You make dinner without it feeling like one more thing to survive. The bedtime conversation with your kids has something behind it. You laugh at something stupid and it's real, not performed.

You're not patient because you're trying to be. You're patient because there's something left to give from. Not a holiday. Not a spa day. Just enough back in the tank that what you give actually has you in it.

So this week, I'm not asking you to do more. I'm asking you to protect one charge. One. The thing you were about to cancel, postpone, or quietly talk yourself out of. The swim. The call. The walk before the house wakes up. Twenty minutes with a closed door and no one else's problems.

Ask yourself: is this a drain, or is this a charge? And if it's a charge, that's the one thing you don't cancel this week. Not because it's a luxury you need to earn. Because without it, everything else you give comes out a little dimmer.

Sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is make sure there's something left to give.

So this week... is the week of capacity.

Thanks for being here. I'll talk to you next week.
