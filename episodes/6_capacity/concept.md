# Episode 6: Capacity — You can't pour from empty

## Theme
When we're running low, we do the exact opposite of what our phone does in low power mode. The phone cuts background drains and protects what matters. We keep every drain running (emails, obligations, saying yes) and cut the things that would actually recharge us (the swim, the friend, the early night). We cut the charges because they feel optional. The drains feel like duty. And duty always wins.

## Pillar(s)
- **Relax** — the threshold effect, allostatic load, the cumulative cost of chronic depletion.
- **Sleep** — the early night that keeps getting sacrificed.
- **Move** — the Thursday swim that gets cancelled first.
- Cross-pillar episode: the point is that we sacrifice all four pillars when we're depleted, and those are exactly the things that would bring us back.

## Key principles drawn from
- **The Threshold Effect** — every individual has a threshold for cumulative stress load. Health problems manifest when multiple stressors push you over your personal threshold.
- **Allostatic Load** — the cumulative "wear and tear" from being stuck in sympathetic mode. Not dramatic stress, but the quiet, persistent kind.
- **Drains vs. charges framing** — reframes self-care from "indulgent luxury" to "essential maintenance." The swim isn't a nice-to-have. Without it, everything else you give comes out dimmer.
- **Exercise overdose principle** — matches movement intensity to current capacity. When you're burned out, a gentle walk restores. HIIT depletes further.

## The deeper emotional truth
Being exhausted can start to feel like proof you're doing it right. We wear our depletion like a badge. "I'm so busy" becomes identity. But tired is not a personality. And empty is not a virtue. The Jacinda Ardern reference makes this concrete — the most powerful person in a country choosing to stop before empty.

## Creative approach used
- **Extended metaphor** — the phone at 3% battery. Low power mode. The phone is smart about what it cuts. We do the exact opposite.
- The duty framing: charges feel optional, drains feel non-negotiable. This reframe is the core engine.
- Jacinda Ardern stepping down — "I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice."

## CTA
Protect one charge this week. The thing you were about to cancel, postpone, or talk yourself out of. Not because it's a luxury you need to earn. Because without it, everything else you give comes out a little dimmer.
