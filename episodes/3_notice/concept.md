# Episode 3: Notice — A guided meditation

## Theme
A different format — slower, experiential. Most people think they "can't meditate" because their mind wanders. But the wandering isn't the failure. The moment you notice you've wandered is the entire practice. You already did it. You just didn't know it counted. The episode becomes a gentle guided noticing exercise mid-way through.

## Pillar(s)
- **Relax** — conscious access to the parasympathetic state. Noticing is the simplest tool for shifting out of autopilot and into presence.
- Ripple across all four — when you're present, you notice hunger vs. craving (Eat), you notice fatigue vs. boredom (Sleep), you notice tension vs. genuine tiredness (Move).

## Key principles drawn from
- **Present-moment awareness** (Eckhart Tolle) — "We're never fully in the now, because unconsciously, we believe the next moment must be more important than this one." Used as a single reference to ground the philosophy.
- **Nervous system regulation** — noticing sensory input (sounds, temperature, contact with surfaces) is a direct parasympathetic activation. You're telling the body: right now, in this actual moment, you're okay.
- **Autopilot and the Modern Mismatch** — we eat while checking emails, drive without remembering turns, ask "how are you?" without hearing the answer. Not because we don't care, but because there's so much coming at us we've learned to tune it out.

## The deeper emotional truth
When you spend your whole day half-present, the days feel long but the weeks feel short. Time passes through you rather than with you. Noticing pulls you back — not forever, just long enough to remember the present exists.

## Creative approach used
- **Format break** — this episode includes a live guided noticing exercise with timed pauses ([2s], [6s], [10s]). Different texture from previous episodes.
- Opens by disarming the "I'm not a meditation person" objection immediately.
- The muscle analogy: "That's like saying you're bad at exercise because your muscles get tired."
- No dramatic reframe — the insight is quieter. You're not learning something new. You're remembering something you already know how to do.

## CTA
Nothing to change. Nothing to start. Once a day, for a few seconds, notice one real thing — when the kettle boils, when the water's warm on your hands, when you sit down at the end of the day. On purpose.
