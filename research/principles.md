# Principles to Introduce

> Core health principles for Do Weekly episodes. These inform the writing — they should never be explained or named in the script itself.

## The Body Keeps Score (Biological Memory)

Your body remembers everything — every habit, every stress pattern, every night of broken sleep. It doesn't forget just because you do. This isn't punishment. It's feedback. The body is constantly adapting to what you give it. Give it chaos, it prepares for chaos. Give it consistency, it starts to trust.

- **Script use:** When the listener feels "off" but can't explain why, this is often the answer. The body is responding to a pattern they haven't noticed yet.
- **Relates to:** Sleep, stress, movement, gut health.

---

## The Threshold Effect

Everyone has a stress threshold — a line where the body tips from coping to struggling. Most people don't notice it until they've crossed it. The symptoms (fatigue, anxiety, poor sleep, weight gain) aren't the problem. They're the alarm.

The goal isn't to eliminate stress. It's to stay under the threshold. Small habits act as buffers — they raise the threshold or lower the load.

- **Script use:** Helps explain why someone can "handle it" for months and then suddenly can't. Nothing changed except the accumulation.
- **Relates to:** Capacity, burnout, the "I'm fine" trap.

---

## The Ripple Effect (Interconnected Systems)

The body is one system, not four separate ones. A small change in one pillar creates ripples across all others. One early night improves morning energy, which makes movement easier, which improves appetite regulation, which improves sleep. The ripple works in both directions — one bad habit cascades too.

- **Script use:** This is why "just start with one thing" works. The listener doesn't need to fix everything. One small change does more than they think.
- **Relates to:** The 4 pillars, compound effect, B=MAP.

---

## The Modern Mismatch

Our biology evolved for a world that no longer exists. Movement was built into survival. Food was seasonal and whole. Light followed the sun. Community was unavoidable. Modern life has removed all of these defaults. We now have to consciously choose what used to be automatic.

- **Script use:** Removes blame. "It's not a character flaw. It's a design mismatch." The listener isn't broken — the environment is.
- **Relates to:** Environment > willpower, processed food, screen time, sedentary work.

---

## Identity-Based Change

Lasting change comes from shifting who you believe you are, not just what you do. "I'm someone who moves" is more powerful than "I should exercise more." Small, repeated behaviours shape self-perception over time. The goal is to make the behaviour feel like part of who you are — not something you have to force.

- **Script use:** The engine underneath everything. Every episode should subtly reinforce: you're not trying to become someone new. You're becoming more of who you already are.
- **Relates to:** Habits, self-talk, the verdict (setbacks), permission.

---

## B=MAP (Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Prompt)

From BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits. Since motivation is unreliable, we focus on making behaviours radically simple and anchoring them to existing habits. "After I boil the kettle, I'll stretch for 30 seconds." The prompt is the anchor. The ability is the simplicity. Motivation is the least reliable leg of the stool.

- **Script use:** Underpins every CTA. The "one thing to try" should always be simple enough that motivation barely matters.
- **Relates to:** Health snacks, tiny habits, environment design.

## Emotions Create Habits

Repetition alone doesn't create habits. Repetition plus positive emotion does. The brain rewires through neuroplasticity — but only when the experience feels good. This is why forcing yourself to run at 5am in the rain doesn't stick. It's also why celebrating small wins matters more than most people think.

- **Script use:** The listener needs to enjoy the process, not just endure it. If the habit feels like punishment, it won't last.
- **Relates to:** Savouring, celebration, the "shine" (BJ Fogg), identity reinforcement.

---

## Environment > Willpower

Willpower is a finite resource. Environment is always on. Design your surroundings so the right choices become automatic and the wrong ones become harder. Put the trainers by the door. Move the biscuits to a high shelf. Charge your phone in another room.

- **Script use:** One of the most practical principles. Whenever the CTA involves changing a behaviour, consider whether the environment can do the heavy lifting instead.
- **Relates to:** Supermarket, screen time, sleep environment, kitchen layout.

---

## The Want Brain vs The Wise Brain

From Dr Rangan Chatterjee. The Want Brain is reactive, emotional, short-term. It reaches for the scroll, the snack, the easy option. The Wise Brain is reflective, long-term, aligned with values. Both are always present. The question isn't how to silence the Want Brain — it's how to make the Wise Brain louder.

- **Script use:** Useful for moments of choice. "That pull you feel at 9pm isn't hunger. It's the Want Brain." Naming it gives the listener power over it.
- **Relates to:** Evening routines, snacking, screen time, impulse vs intention.

---

## Root Causes, Not Symptoms

Many modern health issues (fatigue, poor sleep, gut problems, anxiety) are not isolated diseases but symptoms. They're the body's way of signalling a deeper, underlying imbalance. Treating the symptom without addressing the root cause is like turning off the smoke alarm instead of putting out the fire.

- **Script use:** Reframes the listener's frustration. "You're not broken. Your body is telling you something." Moves from diagnosis to curiosity.
- **Relates to:** Threshold effect, interconnected systems, the 4 pillars.

---

## The Compound Effect

Small actions compound over time. One early night means nothing. Thirty early nights changes your biology. The problem is that the compounding is invisible in the short term. People quit because they can't see the progress. But it's there, accumulating underneath.

- **Script use:** Counters the "it's not working" narrative. The progress is real. It's just not visible yet. This is the antidote to the verdict (setbacks episode).
- **Relates to:** Identity, consistency, the boring middle, patience.

---

## Flow State

From Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. The state of being fully absorbed in an activity — where challenge meets skill, time disappears, and the inner critic goes quiet. Flow isn't reserved for athletes or artists. It's available in cooking, walking, conversation, gardening. Anything where you're fully present and slightly stretched.

- **Script use:** Connects to savouring, movement, and presence. The listener has experienced flow — they just might not have a name for it.
- **Relates to:** Savouring, movement, presence, the opposite of scrolling.

---

## Blue Zones Principles

From Dan Buettner's research into the world's longest-lived communities. The common threads: natural movement (not gym sessions), strong social bonds, sense of purpose, plant-heavy diets, moderate alcohol, stress-reduction rituals, and belonging to a community. None of these are extreme. All of them are consistent.

- **Script use:** Evidence that health isn't about optimisation — it's about ordinary habits done consistently in a supportive environment. The listener doesn't need a biohacking protocol. They need a walk with a friend.
- **Relates to:** Community, movement, moderation, rituals, purpose.

---

## Present-Moment Awareness

From Eckhart Tolle. Most suffering comes from reliving the past or fearing the future. The present moment is usually fine. Learning to notice when the mind has left the room — and gently bringing it back — is the foundation of mental wellbeing. This isn't meditation. It's just attention.

- **Script use:** Underpins the savouring episode and the notice episode. Also relevant to anxiety, rumination, and the "Sunday dread."
- **Relates to:** Savouring, mindfulness, the scroll, rest vs distraction.

## Core Happiness

From Dr Rangan Chatterjee. Three pillars: alignment (living according to your values), contentment (appreciating what you have), and engagement (being absorbed in what you do). Happiness isn't a feeling to chase — it's a byproduct of living in a way that matches who you are.

- **Script use:** Useful for reframing what "health" means. It's not optimisation. It's alignment. The listener isn't trying to be perfect — they're trying to be themselves.
- **Relates to:** Identity, values, purpose, permission, enough.
