# Metaphors

A bank of metaphors and analogies organised by what they illustrate. These are reusable creative tools — a metaphor can appear in multiple episodes in different ways. Only tag with *(used ep X)* if the exact framing was used and shouldn't be repeated verbatim.

## Energy and capacity
- **Phone at 3% battery** — low power mode. The phone is smart: cuts drains, protects what matters. We do the opposite. *(used ep 4)*
- **Drains vs. charges** — things that deplete vs. things that restore. We cancel the charges because they feel optional.
- **Runway** — you need enough runway to take off. If the runway is too short, it doesn't matter how good the plane is.
- **Borrowed relief** — people-pleasing relief is borrowed. You pay it back later, with interest, in tiredness and quiet frustration.

## Habits and identity
- **Votes** — every small action is a vote for who you're becoming. You don't need to win every vote, just the majority. *(used ep 1)*
- **Compound interest** — tiny actions compound over time. 1% better each day.
- **Grooves in a record** — habits wear grooves in the brain. The deeper the groove, the more automatic the behaviour.

## Food and nourishment
- **Empty calories for your mood** — scrolling, snacking, the lie-in. They go down easy but leave you hungrier.
- **Pharmacy inside you** — the gut as an internal pharmacy, manufacturing serotonin, training the immune system.
- **Sugar rollercoaster** — the spike-crash-crave cycle. Not a character flaw, a hormonal loop.

## Time and rhythm
- **Two mornings** — same person, same life. One morning after scrolling, one after an intentional evening. Different night, different morning.
- **Two kitchens** — same kitchen, same onions, same person across the table. One scene from fullness, one from obligation. Same act, completely different experience.
- **Seasons** — everything is a phase. Winter isn't failure. It's preparation.

## Sleep and the night
- **Campfire** — the 90-minute wind-down. Dim, warm light. The opposite of screens.
- **Tomorrow is already listening** — what you do tonight writes tomorrow's first page.

## Movement and the body
- **Bank account / pension fund** — muscle as a longevity pension. You're depositing now for decades from now.
- **Metabolic bank account** — muscles store blood sugar. Movement creates room in the account.
- **Muscle / exercise analogy** — "That's like saying you're bad at exercise because your muscles get tired." Applied to meditation: the wandering is the exercise.

## Stress and stillness
- **Sediment in a glass** — stress settles like sediment. If you never let the glass sit still, you're always drinking cloudy water.
- **Thermostat vs. thermometer** — a thermometer reacts to the environment. A thermostat sets it. Are you reacting to your life or setting the conditions?

## Attention and autopilot
- **Current in a river** — autopilot is a current. You're not choosing to drift, you're just not choosing not to. Noticing is the paddle.
- **The road less travelled** — Robert Frost reframed as the daily choice between the scroll and the walk. *(used ep 2)*

## Growth and patience
- **Garden** — you can't force growth. You prepare the soil, plant, water, and wait. Health works the same way.
- **Seeds** — planting now for a harvest you won't see yet.
- **Chopping wood** — before enlightenment, chop wood. After enlightenment, chop wood. The mundane work doesn't stop. It becomes the point.
