# Voices

Key influences and their core ideas. A living reference for the scriptwriter — who said what, and what it means for Do Weekly.

## Dr. Rangan Chatterjee
**Progressive Medicine, 4-Pillar Framework**
- Root causes, not symptoms. The 360° view of health.
- The 4-pillar interconnected system (Relax, Eat, Move, Sleep) and the ripple effect between them.
- The "Want Brain" — the evolutionary dopamine circuit that falsely promises lasting happiness through external things.
- "Junk Happiness" — overeating, scrolling, alcohol used to numb the "dis-ease" when the Want Brain's promises fall flat.
- Core Happiness model: Alignment, Control, Contentment.
- The 3 F's exercise for emotional eating: Feel, Feed, Find.
- Micro Stress Doses (MSDs) — the pings, emails, and daily friction that keep us stuck in sympathetic mode.
- "Health snacks" — radically simple habits that fit into existing life.

## James Clear
**Atomic Habits, Identity-Based Change**
- "Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."
- The most lasting change comes from focusing on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve.
- "I'm trying to walk more" vs. "I'm someone who walks."
- Used in Episode 1 (Identity).

## B.J. Fogg
**Tiny Habits, B=MAP Model**
- Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
- Since motivation is unreliable, focus on Ability (make it tiny) and Prompt (anchor to existing habit).
- Celebration is the key: emotions create habits, not repetition. The immediate positive feeling after a tiny action is a dopamine instruction to repeat.

## Eckhart Tolle
**Present-Moment Awareness**
- "We're never fully in the now, because unconsciously, we believe the next moment must be more important than this one."
- Transcending the thinking mind. The gap between stimulus and response.
- Most anxiety is about the past or the future — right now, in this actual moment, we're usually okay.
- Used in Episode 3 (Notice).

## Professor Matt Walker
**Sleep Science**
- "There is no tissue within the body and no process within the brain that is not enhanced by sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don't get enough."
- Sleep as the master regulator — the foundation the other three pillars sit on.
- Poor sleep increases ghrelin (hunger), decreases leptin (fullness). You wake up programmed to eat more.
- Sleep debt is non-recoverable. You cannot "catch up" on weekends.
- The amygdala becomes hyper-reactive without adequate sleep — emotional fragility is physiological, not psychological.

## Dr. Satchin Panda
**Chronobiology, Time-Restricted Feeding**
- Melatonin impairs insulin response — the same meal at 9pm causes a larger blood sugar spike than at 6pm. This is non-negotiable biology.
- Time-restricted feeding (e.g., 12-hour eating window) may be as effective as calorie restriction for metabolic health.
- The body expects to eat during the day and repair at night.

## Professor Russell Foster
**Circadian Rhythms, Light/Dark Contrast**
- The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is set by contrast — it needs a strong "IT'S DAY" signal and a clear "IT'S NIGHT" signal.
- Modern life inverts this: weak day signals (indoors), strong night signals (screens).
- The 90-minute "campfire" wind-down: dim, warm lighting, no screens. Allows melatonin to rise naturally.

## Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
**Flow State**
- "Flow" — being so completely absorbed in an activity that time disappears.
- A powerful antidote to the "Want Brain." Activates Core Happiness through dopamine, endorphins, serotonin.
- The sweet spot: ~4% harder than your current skill level. Growth and challenge, not comfort and repetition.
- Used in Episode 2 (Discomfort) — aliveness comes from stretch, not ease.

## Dan Buettner
**Blue Zones**
- Studied the world's longest-lived populations.
- Common threads: natural movement throughout the day, plant-heavy diet, strong community and purpose, rituals for stress relief.
- Longevity is not about individual discipline — it's about environment and culture.

## Dr. James Levine
**NEAT, The Danger of Sitting**
- "Sitting is a lethal activity."
- After 60-90 minutes of sitting, muscles' ability to absorb blood sugar decreases.
- Physical inactivity accounts for 5% of all deaths worldwide — greater health risk than being overweight.
- The antidote is frequent movement snacks, not one gym session.

## Dr. Ian Spreadbury
**Cellular vs. Acellular Carbohydrates**
- Not all carbs are equal. Cellular carbs (sweet potatoes, carrots, intact grains) have intact cellular structure and natural fibre wrapping. Acellular carbs (flour, bread, pasta, crisps) are high-density and refined.
- Acellular carbs drive gut damage, microbiome disturbance, and systemic inflammation.
- Explains why populations thriving on high-carb diets (e.g., Okinawans eating sweet potatoes) don't suffer Western metabolic damage.

## Professor Dale Bredesen
**Neuroplasticity, Alzheimer's Reversal**
- Multi-pronged lifestyle protocol (including 12-hour fasts) has reversed early memory loss.
- Demonstrates that lifestyle changes physically remodel brain structure — the brain changes in response to how we live.
