Introduction
With this programme, we aim to turn health from something that seems complex and confusing into something simple, actionable and meaningful. Simplicity does not need to come at the cost of scientific accuracy, which is why we maintain a strong scientific foundation for our approach.

We are a lifestyle programme, but have put utmost care into selecting the right biomarkers for you to focus on: highlighting the essentials that really matter rather than overtesting.

We start your journey on Do Health with an annual screening test that is more extensive and includes a lot of markers you might know from other blood tests. What we really focus on are the core 11 markers we have defined. We will test these every four months.

They tell you more about the things you can do about your metabolic health. We’re here to look at your blood results as part of a personalised lifestyle programme putting your metabolic health front-and-center to help you take the best next steps to long-term, actionable health. Whether your goal is reducing your risk of diabetes, managing your inflammation or simply feeling better in yourself, we offer a programme that coaches you through positive lifestyle changes that are personal to you. Your biomarkers are only one input into the programme as we support you on improving your lifestyle with the Four Pillar Framework.  

Below, we’ve included the science behind each biomarker in our programme with clinical literature referenced to support how it can be improved through lifestyle, as well as why improving it matters to your long term health. As science evolves, we will continue to evolve our programme.
HbA1c
HbA1c is a marker that looks at your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. It is a medium-term marker that is not influenced by short-term choices (i.e. a sugary drink the day before will not change this measurement). It is used in the investigation of pre-diabetes and diabetes to show you how your body handles sugar. 

The impact of lifestyle
Research supports the claim that HbA1c can be positively affected through:
Exercise (Umpierre et al., 2011)  - the type of exercise isn’t what matters, it’s about being active for however long you can, even if brisk walking is all you can do at the moment. Both strength training and/or aerobic exercise help to reduce HbA1c over time. Aiming for more than 150 mins of exercise weekly (~22 mins daily) is recommended.
Diet (Dorans et al., 2022) - lower carbohydrate diets help to reduce HbA1c over time, at least as much as low-fat diets do. Carbohydrates get broken down into simple sugar, which is absorbed in the blood. Refined carbs do this quicker and are more harmful. Lowering your overall intake of carbs keeps your average blood sugar low.
Weight loss (Palmer et al., 2025) - reductions in weight, waist circumference, and percentage body fat have all been shown to improve HbA1c levels over time. While we don’t want to focus on the scales, weight loss often goes hand in hand with activity and a healthy diet. Please note that weight loss is not safe for everyone, this study only refers to a population with a BMI of 25 and above.

Why improving it matters
In those with type 2 diabetes, keeping HbA1c low over time helps to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular and nerve-related disease (Boye et al., 2022). In those without type 2 diabetes, lifestyle modifications have been shown to have a significant impact in reducing the risk of developing the condition (The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002).
Fasting Insulin
Fasting insulin measures the level of insulin in your blood after an 8-hour fast and gives insight into how hard your body needs to work to keep blood sugar stable when you’ve not had anything to eat. Your body needs some insulin even while not eating to maintain balance, but high levels of fasting insulin usually mean that the cells in your body have become desensitised.

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that fasting insulin can be positively affected through:
Diet and exercise (Knowler et al., 2002) - research into the benefit of lifestyle combinations, particularly with lower calorie, low fat diets alongside regular physical activity, lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. In this study, ~3 years of maintaining a lifestyle programme with at least 150 minutes of exercise each week showed a 58% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Walking (Herzig et al., 2014) - regular periods of walking over time can meaningfully impact your sensitivity to the insulin that your body releases. This study showed that 60 minutes of walking three times a week over 3 months significantly lowered fasting insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity.

Why improving it matters
Higher fasting insulin levels show a strong association with insulin resistance, which is one of the ways in which type 2 diabetes develops (Kosmas et al., 2023). It is also associated with cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of blood clots (Meigs et al., 2000).
hs-CRP
hs-CRP is a marker of low level inflammation in the body. It can rise when there is ongoing physical stress, illness, or longer term inflammation.

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that hs-CRP can be positively affected through:
Exercise (Plaisance et al., 2006) - as your physical activity levels increase, evidence shows that your hs-CRP levels are likely to reduce over time. Consistent exercise three times a week can improve hs-CRP levels by more than 40%.
Smoking reduction (Gallus et al., 2018) - smoking has a direct relationship with higher hs-CRP levels which take a long time to reverse. Cutting back on cigarette smoking has been shown to lower hs-CRP, but requires being cigarette-free for longer periods of time (at least 4 years) for the effects to be seen. Vaping is something which needs more focused research, as the current scientific evidence is inconclusive for us to make meaningful recommendations.

Why improving it matters
Higher hs-CRP levels have been shown to have a strong association with a higher risk of cardiovascular complications e.g. heart attacks, strokes. It is a way of predicting cardiovascular risk in the general population (Kurt et al., 2025).
HDL
HDL cholesterol is often described as “good cholesterol”. It is linked with how your body transports cholesterol from your body to your liver for processing.

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that HDL can be positively affected through:
Diet (Mensink et al. 2003) - a diet that adds in unsaturated fats, such as fish, seeds, nuts, avocados, to replace the carbohydrates they would normally consume, is linked to having a higher HDL level. 
Exercise (Wang et al., 2017) - aerobic exercise, specifically 150 minutes per week (~22 mins daily) for at least 12 weeks, has been shown to boost HDL levels over time, while also having positive effects on other cholesterol markers.

Why improving it matters
Higher HDL levels have protective effects on the heart and blood vessels. Up to a point, the more you have, the better. The benchmark research done is called The Framingham Heart Study that showed that lower HDL levels were associated with a higher risk of heart disease (Wilson et al., 1988).

Triglycerides
Triglycerides are the type of fat in your blood that your body doesn’t need straight away. They are stored in fat cells in your body. Small amounts are fine, but generally lower is better.

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that triglycerides can be positively affected through:
Exercise (Kelley et al., 2011) - studies of individuals doing at least 25 minutes of regular activity that raises heart rate, including brisk walking, jogging and cycling over a period of at least 12 weeks, show significant improvements in triglyceride levels, especially when combined with dietary changes.
Diet (Clifton, 2018; Luna-Castillo et al., 2022) - eating more fibre, fish and swapping simple, refined carbohydrates with complex ones have been shown to lower triglyceride levels over time, with significant reductions seen from 3 months to 12 months.

Why improving it matters
Higher triglyceride levels are associated with greater cardiovascular risk. There is evidence that lowering levels to a normal range, as well as further ‘optimising’ them, results in better outcomes. (Aberra et al., 2020).
Homocysteine
Homocysteine is a natural amino acid found in the blood. Higher levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s risk (Seshadri et al. 2002).

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that homocysteine can be positively affected through:
Diet (Riddell et al., 2000; Schenkelaars et al., 2024) - a diet rich in folate, from leafy greens and kale, folate supplementation and lowering ultra-processed food (UPF) intake have been shown to significantly lower homocysteine levels by ~24% over a 1 year period.

Why improving it matters
Evidence suggests that higher homocysteine can cause heart disease and carry a higher risk of blood clots (Clarke et al. 2010).

ALT & AST
ALT and AST are enzymes released into the blood during normal liver cell renewal and in greater amounts when liver cells are stressed or damaged. ALT primarily reflects liver cell injury, whereas AST is less specific and can also rise with muscle or heart stress.

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that ALT and AST can be positively affected through:
Exercise (Slomko et al. 2021) - there is strong evidence to show the impact of aerobic exercise, mostly around 150 minutes of heart rate raising exertion per week (~22 mins daily), on lowering ALT and AST, where there is likely to be meaningful impact by week 16.
Diet (Varkeneh et al. 2022) - in those with existing, non-alcoholic liver disease, low calorie diets, maintained for at least 6 weeks, significantly lower ALT and AST.
Alcohol (Agarwal et al. 2016) - higher volumes of alcohol intake have been shown to raise AST in particular. Moderating alcohol intake is key in lowering AST levels.

Why improving it matters
Higher ALT and AST levels have a strong association with metabolic syndrome, a condition characterised by obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (Rana-Cano et al. 2023). Furthermore, high ALT levels has been independently linked to type 2 diabetes risk (Kunutsor et al. 2013). 

ApoB
ApoB is a protein in your blood that is mostly found in ‘bad’ cholesterol particles. There is evidence to suggest that it may be more sensitive than other cholesterol markers in the detection of cardiovascular disease (Walldius et al., 2001, Marston et al. 2022).

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that ApoB can be positively affected through:
Diet (Lamantia et al., 2016) - lower calorie diets with lower carbohydrates, higher unsaturated fats and omega 3 supplementation show significant reductions in ApoB levels over a 6 month period.
Exercise (Holme et al., 2007) - exercise regimes of 1 hour, three times a week showed a significant reduction, around ~7%, in ApoB levels after 1 year.

Why improving it matters
The close relationship between ApoB levels and LDL cholesterol levels makes it challenging to fully separate the beneficial effects of just lowering ApoB alone. However, there is evidence to suggest that lower ApoB levels are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Khan et al., 2020).

Vitamin D
Vitamin D is the ‘sunshine’ vitamin in your body. It is responsible for key processes such as calcium absorption and phosphorus absorption, which allow for healthy bones and muscles. In the context of metabolic health, there is a strong link between lower vitamin D levels and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (Jani et al., 2021).

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that vitamin D can be positively affected through:
Diet (Lee et al., 2023) - while there are foods that are naturally higher in vitamin D, such as fatty fish and some types of mushrooms, there is evidence to suggest that in general, a traditionally ‘healthy’ diet is associated with a higher level of vitamin D. This type of diet focuses on fruits, leafy green vegetables and nuts.
Supplementation (NHS - Vitamin D) - due to the often limited sun exposure in the UK, the government recommends all adults to consider a vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms daily from October to March.
Smoking reduction (Yang et al., 2021) - there is evidence to show that smoking negatively affects circulating levels of vitamin D. In this analysis, those who smoked have up to a 29% greater risk of having deficient levels of vitamin D.

Why improving it matters
The endocrine society guidelines make it clear that the need for routine screening and daily supplementation rises as you get older (Demay et al., 2024). Being above the cut-off for a ‘healthy’ level i.e. above 50nmol/L is more important than increasing it past this point. Regular supplementation of vitamin D becomes a strong recommendation in those above 75 years of age, or in those who are high risk pre-diabetic.
Uric Acid
Uric acid is a natural by-product of protein breakdown in the body. Although it is traditionally used in the diagnosis and monitoring of gout, high uric acid levels have been linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease (Zuo et al., 2016).

The impact of lifestyle
Research suggests that uric acid can be positively affected through:
Diet (Gohari et al., 2023) - a diet made up of mainly fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products and moderate protein intake, after being followed for at least 4 weeks, has been shown to significantly lower uric acid levels.
Alcohol reduction (Ma et al., 2025) - this study shows that drinking more alcohol is associated with a higher uric acid level. When comparing those who drank alcohol to those who didn’t, there was a 69% increased risk of having uric acid levels that are considered too high.

Why improving it matters
Large studies have been conducted that show that higher uric acid levels are an independent risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease and heart rhythm problems (Hou et al., 2025). However, further research is needed to establish the conclusive impact of lowering uric acid on long-term outcomes.
Conclusion
Our approach to making meaningful lifestyle recommendations will always be grounded in scientific evidence, because this is the most responsible way to support better health through lifestyle. We focus on a small set of core markers that are both important and realistically changeable over time, so you can see progress clearly rather than feeling overwhelmed by data.

Blood tests are not a verdict on your health, they are a feedback tool. They help you spot patterns, understand what is happening beneath the surface, and focus your effort where it is most likely to pay off. The goal is not perfection, it is direction. Small, consistent changes in what you eat, how you move, how you sleep, and how you manage stress can shift these markers over time.

We know that health is personal. Not every strategy is right for every person, and your plan should fit your life, preferences, and starting point. That is why we support you to take one step at a time, build momentum, and make changes you can actually keep. As science evolves, we will keep updating our programme so your recommendations stay current, practical, and evidence-led.
