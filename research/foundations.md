# Foundations

Distilled, script-ready principles from the Do Health philosophy. Not the full scientific detail (see `/projects/principles/Principles to Introduce.md` for that) — just the ideas in a form the scriptwriter can scan quickly.

## The 4-Pillar System
**Relax, Eat, Move, Sleep** — a single, interconnected system. You cannot look at one in isolation.

- **The Ripple Effect:** A small change in one pillar creates a positive cascade across all others. Morning light (Move/Sleep) → better sleep → regulated hunger hormones (Eat) → reduced cravings → more energy (Move).
- **The Threshold Effect:** Every individual has a personal threshold for cumulative stress. Health problems surface when stressors across pillars push someone over that threshold. Modest improvements across all four pillars (2+2+2+2=8) beats perfecting one or two (5+5=10).

## Root Causes, Not Symptoms
Many modern health issues — fatigue, poor sleep, gut problems, anxiety — are symptoms, not diseases. They are the body signalling a deeper imbalance. We address the root cause, not the plaster.

## The Modern Mismatch
Our biology evolved for movement, whole foods, natural light, and community. Modern life creates the opposite: sitting, processed food, screens, isolation. This mismatch predictably creates "dis-ease."

## Identity-Based Change
Lasting change comes from shifting who you believe you are, not just what you do. "I'm someone who walks" vs. "I'm trying to walk more." Small, repeated behaviours shape self-perception over time. The goal is to make the behaviour feel automatic — like putting the kettle on.

## B=MAP — How Change Sticks
**Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Prompt** (B.J. Fogg). Since motivation is unreliable:
- **Ability:** Make the behaviour radically simple ("health snacks")
- **Prompt:** Anchor to an existing automatic habit ("After I boil the kettle...")
- **Celebration:** Emotions create habits, not repetition. Immediate positive emotion after a small action releases dopamine — a rewiring instruction, not a reward.

## Environment > Willpower
We don't fail from lack of willpower; we fail because we're fighting our surroundings. Design the environment so the right choices become automatic and the wrong ones require effort.

## The "Want Brain" vs. Core Happiness
The dopamine circuit that drives us toward external things (a treat, a scroll, a purchase) produces "Junk Happiness" — goes down easy, leaves you hungrier. **Core Happiness** stands on three legs:
1. **Alignment** — living according to your internal values
2. **Control** — having agency over your life
3. **Contentment** — being satisfied in the present moment

## Drains vs. Charges
When depleted, we keep every drain running (obligations, emails, saying yes) and cut the things that would recharge us (the swim, the friend, the early night). We cut the charges because they feel optional. The drains feel like duty. Reframe: the charges are essential maintenance, not luxury.

## Sleep as Master Regulator
There is no tissue within the body and no process within the brain that is not enhanced by sleep. Poor sleep increases ghrelin (hunger), decreases leptin (fullness), and makes the amygdala hyper-reactive (anxiety). Sleep debt is non-recoverable.

## The Evening Window
The best morning routine starts at 9pm. Melatonin impairs insulin response — the same meal at 9pm is more metabolically damaging than at 6pm. The 90-minute wind-down (dim light, no screens) allows melatonin to rise naturally.

## Movement as Metabolic Signal
Muscles are the body's primary "metabolic bank account." Moving after meals makes muscles more sensitive to insulin, pulling sugar from the bloodstream without a large hormonal response. Frequent movement snacks throughout the day beat one intense session.

## The Gut-Brain Axis
The gut manufactures the vast majority of the body's serotonin. Diverse plant fibre feeds diverse microbes, which produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and strengthen the gut barrier. 30 plant varieties per week is the target.

## Connection as a Core Need
Loneliness activates the body's threat response. Humans are tribal — isolation was evolutionary danger. Both deep connections and daily micro-connections (the barista chat) signal safety to the nervous system.
